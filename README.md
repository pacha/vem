Vem
===

Vem is an alternative command layout for the Vim text editor. It provides full
keyboard control over the editor while trying to be as simple and intuitive as
possible.

![Vem Text Editor](doc/img/vem-main-screenshot.png)

Vem is a set of configuration files for the Vim text editor that changes how you
interact with it. While Vim is extremely expressive and provides hundreds of
commands with their own small grammar, Vem takes the opposite approach and
defines a reduced, simplified set of commands that are executed, in most cases,
immediately after a single key press. The commands are also distributed
spatially across the keyboard, like in a map, optimizing their position
according to their frequency.

The result is a different editor, strongly focused on the user experience, that
strives to be as simple as possible while still giving you total control using
just the keyboard. Since it uses actual Vim as base, you can also make use of
its many advanced features.

Vem requires either Vim or Neovim to be installed in the system and supports the
`QWERTY`, `QWERTZ` and `AZERTY` keyboard layouts.
